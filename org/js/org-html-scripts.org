# -*- org-confirm-babel-evaluate: nil; -*-
#+TITLE: Dump the Default javascript
#+SETUPFILE: publish-setup.org

I just manually run this source block to export the default org-mode javascript.

The variable contains a script HTML element.  That is a problem since I have the text contained in the variable included into the SETUPFILE bye a HEADER option.
I chose to delete the first and last lines of the variable's text output to fix this problem.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent :file org-html-scripts.js
  (print org-html-scripts)
#+END_SRC
