* Raw code to tangle out
** Initialize the publishing properties
How do you force all org files to be rebuilt when this function has been changed?  Normally only the org-mode files that have been changed are rebuilt.

If a file does not export to HTML it can be because an unset variable in a source block.

"Org uses [[http://orgmode.org/guide/Publishing.html][timestamps]] to track when a file has changed. The above functions normally only publish changed files. You can override this and force publishing of all files by giving a prefix argument to any of the commands above."

This [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21258769/using-emacs-org-mode-how-to-publish-the-unchanged-files-in-a-project][post]] has an example of how to "force" a build.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results silent
  rm -fr ./publish-html/*
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent 
  (org-publish-current-project "simple-publish" nil) ; Rebuild files that have a fresh time stamp.
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent 
  (org-publish-current-project "simple-publish" t)   ; Rebuild all files even if the time stamps have not changed.
#+END_SRC
